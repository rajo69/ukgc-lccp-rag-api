In determining whether two or more lotteries are linked it is immaterial how many of them are promoted in reliance on this licence.\na lottery is linked to a free draw or prize competition if:\na person’s participation in, or his being allocated a prize in, the lottery is a means of establishing his eligibility to enter the draw or competition and\nthe arrangements for the lottery and/or the draw or competition are such that a person may win more than £500,000 in aggregate as a result of his participation in the lottery and the draw or competition.\nIf a lottery, whilst not a linked lottery, has the feature that by selecting the same numbers in the lottery and in one or more other lottery or lotteries the participant in those lotteries may win prizes which, in aggregate, exceed £500,000, no advertisement for, nor other marketing of, the lottery may make any reference to that feature.\nLicensees must ensure that each person who purchases a ticket in a lottery promoted on behalf of a non-commercial society in reliance on this licence receives a document which:\nidentifies the promoting society;\nstates the name and address of a member of the society who is designated, by persons acting on behalf of the society, as having responsibility within the society for the promotion of the lottery; and\neither states the date of the draw (or each draw) in the lottery, or enables the date of the draw (or each draw) in the lottery to be determined.\nLicensees must display ‘licensed by the Gambling Commission’ and details of the Gambling Commission website on lottery tickets.\nThe price payable for purchasing each ticket in a lottery promoted in reliance on this licence:\nmust be the same;\nmust be shown on the ticket or in a document received by the purchaser; and\nmust be paid to the promoter of the lottery before any person is given a ticket or any right in respect of membership of the class among whom prizes are to be allocated.\nFor the purposes of these conditions, reference to a person receiving a document includes a reference to a message being sent or displayed to him electronically in a manner which enables him, without incurring significant expense or delay, to:\nretain the message electronically; or\nprint it.\nLicensees must lodge with the Commission a description of, and a copy of the rules of, any lottery intended to be promoted in reliance on this licence, and any amendment to the rules of a lottery previously notified to the Commission, at least 28 days before any tickets in such lottery, or amended lottery, are put on sale\n1\n.\nLottery tickets must not be sold to a person in any street. For these purposes ‘street’ includes any bridge, road, lane, footway, subway, square, court, alley or passage (including passages through enclosed premises such as shopping malls) whether a thoroughfare or not. But, by way of exception, tickets may be sold in a street from a static structure such as a kiosk or display stand. Tickets may also be sold door to door. Licensees must ensure that they have any necessary local authority permissions, such as a street trading licence.\nAccurate accounting records must be kept in relation to all lotteries promoted in reliance on this licence showing:\nthe total proceeds of each lottery;\nthe amount allocated to prizes in each lottery;\nthe amount of proceeds allocated to expenses, and details of those expenses, for each lottery;\nthe amount applied directly to the purposes of the society or purposes for which the local authority has power to incur expenditure as the case may be; and\nthe number of sold and unsold tickets in each lottery.\nSuch records must be made available to the Commission for inspection on request and retained for at least three years from the date of any lottery to which they relate.\nIn addition, in respect of each lottery promoted in reliance on this licence, a lottery submission must be sent to the Commission within three months of the date of determination of the lottery or, in the case of an ‘instant lottery’, within three months of the last date on which tickets in the lottery were on sale providing the information set out in paragraph 13 above. Every such submission must contain or be accompanied by a declaration that the information given in it is correct and must be shown to have been approved before submission by:\nthe holder of a personal management licence\na ‘qualified person’ as defined in the Gambling Act 2005 (Definition of Small-scale Operator) Regulations 2006\n2\nor\nexcept where the licensee is a local authority, the designated person named on the lottery tickets as having responsibility for the promotion of the lottery.\nWhere a society or local authority instructs an External Lottery Manager to make the submission on their behalf, they must ensure that the details on the submission are verified and approved by one of the people named above from the relevant society or local authority.\nFor any calendar year in which the cumulative proceeds of lotteries promoted in reliance on this licence exceed £1,000,000 the licensee must provide the Commission with written confirmation from a qualifying auditor confirming that the proceeds of those lotteries have been fully accounted for in their annual audited accounts.

The options must cover all products and channels provided by the licensee and be set to opt-out by default. These options must be offered as part of the registration process and be updateable should customers change their preference. This requirement applies to all new and existing customers.\nChannel options must include phone call, email and text messages (SMS) as applicable.\nProduct options must include betting, casino, bingo, as applicable. Operators must make clear to customers which products they offer are covered under relevant categories.\nWhere an operator seeks an additional step for customers to confirm their chosen marketing preferences, the structure and wording of that step must be presented in a manner which only asks for confirmation to progress those choices with one click to proceed. There must be no encouragement or option to change selection; only the option to accept or decline their selection.\nCustomers must not receive direct marketing that contravenes their channel or product preferences.\nExisting customers who have not already opted out of marketing must be asked at their first log-in after commencement of this provision to confirm their marketing preferences if they have not done so already. Existing preferences can be copied over providing they match the format of this requirement."
